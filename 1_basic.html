    <p>
      Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly
      known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose
      computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is
      recognized as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine,
      and she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.
